def get_college_tuition():
    """
    Scrapes data on average college tuition costs by state from the Education Data website.


    This function extracts the in-state and out-of-state tuition fees for four-year colleges 
    in each U.S. state (including Washington, D.C.) and compiles the data into a pandas DataFrame. 
    The data is scraped from the HTML structure of the webpage, targeting specific tags and elements.

    Returns:
        pandas.DataFrame: A DataFrame containing the following columns:
            - 'State': The name of the state.
            - 'In-State Tuition': The average tuition cost for in-state students at four-year colleges.
            - 'Out-of-State Tuition': The average tuition cost for out-of-state students at four-year colleges.
    
    Notes:
        - The function assumes the structure of the webpage does not change. If the structure changes, the
          scraping logic may need to be updated.
        - The function currently ignores the tuition data for two-year colleges, focusing only on four-year institutions.
